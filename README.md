# Lesson 14 in Patrick's course

In this project we go through creating 3 NFT projects
with different approaches,

- The first is creacting an NFT by inhereting from open zeppelin and setting the URI

- The second is to use chainlink VRF to mint NFT's with rarity and upload the URI and the images to pinata programatically. I still have to wrap my head around testing the fullfill random words function, should checkout the lottery project again. He explains it really well there

- The third is about an NFT with the image embedded on-chain using base64 encoding and it change the image of the NFT if the price of ETH is higher than a certain value.

- NFT on chain -> URI metadata -> image.

- What an amazing explanation. I made a commitment to sustain myself working on blockchain and this video will play an important role in achieving that goal.
